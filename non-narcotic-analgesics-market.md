<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Narcotic Analgesics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Steroid Antiinflammatory Drug</li><li>Steroid Antiinflammatory Drug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-narcotic analgesics market consists of two primary types: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting enzymes involved in the inflammatory process, making them popular for managing conditions like arthritis and headaches.

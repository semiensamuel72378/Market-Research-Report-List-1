<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheatstone Bridge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balanced Bridge</li><li>Unbalanced Bridge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wheatstone Bridge is used to measure electrical resistance and can be classified into two market types: balanced and unbalanced bridges. A balanced bridge has equal resistances in its two arms, allowing for precise measurement when no current flows through the galvanometer. In contrast, an unbalanced bridge indicates a difference in resistance, causing a current to flow, which must be measured to determine the unknown resistance. Both types are essential in precise electrical testing and sensor applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mushroom Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-way</li><li>3-way</li><li>4-way</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mushroom valves are categorized into three main types based on their configuration: 2-way, 3-way, and 4-way. A 2-way mushroom valve controls flow in a single direction, acting as a simple on/off switch. The 3-way variant allows for flow routing between two paths, often used for mixing or diverting purposes. Meanwhile, the 4-way mushroom valve enables control of multiple flow paths, often regulating actuators or systems requiring complex routing. Each type serves distinct applications in fluid control systems.</p></p>

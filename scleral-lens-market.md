<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scleral Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mini-Scleral Lenses</li><li>Large-Scleral Lenses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The scleral lens market is primarily categorized into mini-scleral lenses and large-scleral lenses. Mini-scleral lenses are smaller, resting on the sclera while covering the cornea, ideal for moderate irregularities and offering comfort and stability. Large-scleral lenses, on the other hand, provide broader coverage and are beneficial for more severe corneal irregularities or conditions, such as keratoconus. Both types utilize a tear reservoir between the lens and the cornea, promoting hydration and enhancing vision quality for those with corneal issues.</p></p>
